<p>. .fi . .IP “” 0 . .SH “DESCRIPTION” Install the gems specified in your
Gemfile(5). If this is the first time you run bundle install (and a
fBGemfile.lockfR does not exist), bundler will fetch all remote sources,
resolve dependencies and install all needed gems. . .P If a
fBGemfile.lockfR does exist, and you have not updated your Gemfile(5),
bundler will fetch all remote sources, but use the dependencies specified
in the fBGemfile.lockfR instead of resolving dependencies. . .P If a
fBGemfile.lockfR does exist, and you have updated your Gemfile(5), bundler
will use the dependencies in the fBGemfile.lockfR for all gems that you did
not update, but will re-resolve the dependencies of gems that you did
update. You can find more information about this update process below under
fICONSERVATIVE UPDATINGfR. . .SH “OPTIONS” . .TP
fB--gemfile=&lt;gemfile&gt;fR The location of the Gemfile(5) that bundler
should use. This defaults to a gemfile in the current working directory. In
general, bundler will assume that the location of the Gemfile(5) is also
the project root, and will look for the fBGemfile.lockfR and
fBvendor/cachefR relative to it. . .TP fB--path=&lt;path&gt;fR The location
to install the gems in the bundle to. This defaults to Rubygems' gem home,
which is also the default location where fBgem installfR installs gems.
This means that, by default, gems installed without a fB--pathfR setting
will show up in fBgem listfR. This setting is a fIremembered optionfR. .
.TP fB--systemfR Installs the gems in the bundle to the system location.
This overrides any previous fIrememberedfR use of fB--pathfR. . .TP
fB--without=&lt;list&gt;fR A space-separated list of groups to skip
installing. This is a fIremembered optionfR. . .TP fB--localfR Do not
attempt to connect to fBrubygems.orgfR, instead using just the gems already
present in Rubygems' cache or in fBvendor/cachefR. Note that if a more
appropriate platform-specific gem exists on fBrubygems.orgfR, it will not
be found. . .TP fB--deploymentfR Switches bundler's defaults into
fIdeployment modefR. Do not use this flag on development machines. . .TP
fB--binstubs[=<directory>]fR Create a directory (defaults to fBbinfR)
containing an executable that runs in the context of the bundle. For
instance, if the fBrailsfR gem comes with a fBrailsfR executable, this flag
will create a fBbin/railsfR executable that ensures that all dependencies
used come from the bundled gems. . .TP fB--shebang ruby-install-namefR Uses
the ruby executable (usually fBrubyfR) provided to execute the scripts
created with --binstubs. For instance, if you use --binstubs with
fB--shebang jrubyfR, all executables will be created to use jruby instead.
. .TP fB--standalone[=<list>]fR Make a bundle that can work without Ruby
Gems or <a href="../../../Bundler.html">Bundler</a> at runtime. It takes a
space separated list of groups to install. It creates a fBbundlefR
directory and installs the bundle there. It also generates a
fBbundle/bundler/setup.rbfR file to replace Bundler's own setup. . .TP
fB--trust-policy=[<policy>]fR Apply the Rubygems security policy named
fIpolicyfR, where policy is one of HighSecurity, MediumSecurity,
LowSecurity, or NoSecurity. For more detail, see the Rubygems signing
documentation, linked below in fISEE ALSOfR. . .TP fB--jobs=[<size>]fR
Install gems parallely by starting fIsizefR number of parallel workers. .
.TP fB--retry[<tries]\fR Retries failed network or git requests \fItries\fR
times\. . .TP \fB\-\-no\-cache\fR Do not update the cache in
\fBvendor/cache\fR with the newly bundled gems\. This does not remove any
existing cached gems, only stops the newly bundled gems from being cached
during the install\. . .TP \fB\-\-quiet\fR Do not print progress
information to stdout\. Instead, communicate the success of the install
operation via exit status code\. . .TP \fB\-\-clean\fR Run bundle clean
automatically after install\. . .TP \fB\-\-full\-index\fR Use the rubygems
modern index instead of the API endpoint\. . .TP \fB\-\-no\-prune\fR Don\'t
remove stale gems from the cache\. . .SH &quot;DEPLOYMENT MODE&quot;
Bundler\'s defaults are optimized for development\. To switch to defaults
optimized for deployment, use the \fB\-\-deployment\fR flag\. Do not
activate deployment mode on development machines, as it will cause in an
error when the <a href="../templates/Gemfile.html">Gemfile</a> is modified.
. .IP “1.” 4 A fBGemfile.lockfR is required. . .IP To ensure that the same
versions of the gems you developed with and tested with are also used in
deployments, a fBGemfile.lockfR is required. . .IP This is mainly to ensure
that you remember to check your fBGemfile.lockfR into version control. .
.IP “2.” 4 The fBGemfile.lockfR must be up to date . .IP In development,
you can modify your Gemfile(5) and re-run fBbundle installfR to
fIconservatively updatefR your fBGemfile.lockfR snapshot. . .IP In
deployment, your fBGemfile.lockfR should be up-to-date with changes made in
your Gemfile(5). . .IP “3.” 4 Gems are installed to fBvendor/bundlefR not
your default system location . .IP In development, it's convenient to share
the gems used in your application with other applications and other scripts
run on the system. . .IP In deployment, isolation is a more important
default. In addition, the user deploying the application may not have
permission to install gems to the system, or the web server may not have
permission to read them. . .IP As a result, fBbundle install --deploymentfR
installs gems to the fBvendor/bundlefR directory in the application. This
may be overridden using the fB--pathfR option. . .IP “” 0 . .SH “SUDO
USAGE” By default, bundler installs gems to the same location as fBgem
installfR. . .P In some cases, that location may not be writable by your
Unix user. In that case, bundler will stage everything in a temporary
directory, then ask you for your fBsudofR password in order to copy the
gems into their system location. . .P From your perspective, this is
identical to installing them gems directly into the system. . .P You should
never use fBsudo bundle installfR. This is because several other steps in
fBbundle installfR must be performed as the current user: . .IP “(bu” 4
Updating your fBGemfile.lockfR . .IP “(bu” 4 Updating your
fBvendor/cachefR, if necessary . .IP “(bu” 4 Checking out private git
repositories using your user's SSH keys . .IP “” 0 . .P Of these three, the
first two could theoretically be performed by fBchownfRing the resulting
files to fB$SUDO_USERfR. The third, however, can only be performed by
actually invoking the fBgitfR command as the current user. Therefore, git
gems are downloaded and installed into fB~/.bundlefR rather than $GEM_HOME
or $BUNDLE_PATH. . .P As a result, you should run fBbundle installfR as the
current user, and bundler will ask for your password if it is needed to put
the gems into their final location. . .SH “INSTALLING GROUPS” By default,
fBbundle installfR will install all gems in all groups in your Gemfile(5),
except those declared for a different platform. . .P However, you can
explicitly tell bundler to skip installing certain groups with the
fB--withoutfR option. This option takes a space-separated list of groups. .
.P While the fB--withoutfR option will skip fIinstallingfR the gems in the
specified groups, it will still fIdownloadfR those gems and use them to
resolve the dependencies of every gem in your Gemfile(5). . .P This is so
that installing a different set of groups on another machine (such as a
production server) will not change the gems and versions that you have
already developed and tested against. . .P fBBundler offers a rock-solid
guarantee that the third-party code you are running in development and
testing is also the third-party code you are running in production. You can
choose to exclude some of that code in different environments, but you will
never be caught flat-footed by different versions of third-party code being
used in different environments.fR . .P For a simple illustration, consider
the following Gemfile(5): . .IP “” 4 . .nf</p>

<p>source “<a href="https://rubygems\.org">rubygems.org</a>”</p>

<p>gem “sinatra”</p>

<p>group :production do</p>

<pre>gem &quot;rack\-perftools\-profiler&quot;</pre>

<p>end . .fi . .IP “” 0 . .P In this case, fBsinatrafR depends on any version
of Rack (fB&gt;= 1.0fR, while fBrack-perftools-profilerfR depends on 1.x
(fB~&gt; 1.0fR). . .P When you run fBbundle install --without productionfR
in development, we look at the dependencies of fBrack-perftools-profilerfR
as well. That way, you do not spend all your time developing against Rack
2.0, using new APIs unavailable in Rack 1.x, only to have bundler switch to
Rack 1.2 when the fBproductionfR group fIisfR used. . .P This should not
cause any problems in practice, because we do not attempt to fBinstallfR
the gems in the excluded groups, and only evaluate as part of the
dependency resolution process. . .P This also means that you cannot include
different versions of the same gem in different groups, because doing so
would result in different sets of dependencies used in development and
production. Because of the vagaries of the dependency resolution process,
this usually affects more than just the gems you list in your Gemfile(5),
and can (surprisingly) radically change the gems you are using. . .SH
“REMEMBERED OPTIONS” Some options (marked above in the fIOPTIONSfR section)
are remembered between calls to fBbundle installfR, and by the <a
href="../../../Bundler.html">Bundler</a> runtime. . .P For instance, if you
run fBbundle install --without testfR, a subsequent call to fBbundle
installfR that does not include a fB--withoutfR flag will remember your
previous choice. . .P In addition, a call to fBBundler.setupfR will not
attempt to make the gems in those groups available on the Ruby load path,
as they were not installed. . .P The settings that are remembered are: .
.TP fB--deploymentfR At runtime, this remembered setting will also result
in <a href="../../../Bundler.html">Bundler</a> raising an exception if the
fBGemfile.lockfR is out of date. . .TP fB--pathfR Subsequent calls to
fBbundle installfR will install gems to the directory originally passed to
fB--pathfR. The <a href="../../../Bundler.html">Bundler</a> runtime will
look for gems in that location. You can revert this option by running
fBbundle install --systemfR. . .TP fB--binstubsfR <a
href="../../../Bundler.html">Bundler</a> will update the executables every
subsequent call to fBbundle installfR. . .TP fB--withoutfR As described
above, <a href="../../../Bundler.html">Bundler</a> will skip the gems
specified by fB--withoutfR in subsequent calls to fBbundle installfR. The
<a href="../../../Bundler.html">Bundler</a> runtime will also not try to
make the gems in the skipped groups available. . .SH “THE GEMFILE.LOCK”
When you run fBbundle installfR, <a
href="../../../Bundler.html">Bundler</a> will persist the full names and
versions of all gems that you used (including dependencies of the gems
specified in the Gemfile(5)) into a file called fBGemfile.lockfR. . .P <a
href="../../../Bundler.html">Bundler</a> uses this file in all subsequent
calls to fBbundle installfR, which guarantees that you always use the same
exact code, even as your application moves across machines. . .P Because of
the way dependency resolution works, even a seemingly small change (for
instance, an update to a point-release of a dependency of a gem in your
Gemfile(5)) can result in radically different gems being needed to satisfy
all dependencies. . .P As a result, you fBSHOULDfR check your
fBGemfile.lockfR into version control. If you do not, every machine that
checks out your repository (including your production server) will resolve
all dependencies again, which will result in different versions of
third-party code being used if fBanyfR of the gems in the Gemfile(5) or any
of their dependencies have been updated. . .SH “CONSERVATIVE UPDATING” When
you make a change to the Gemfile(5) and then run fBbundle installfR, <a
href="../../../Bundler.html">Bundler</a> will update only the gems that you
modified. . .P In other words, if a gem that you fBdid not modifyfR worked
before you called fBbundle installfR, it will continue to use the exact
same versions of all dependencies as it used before the update. . .P Let's
take a look at an example. Here's your original Gemfile(5): . .IP “” 4 .
.nf</p>

<p>source “<a href="https://rubygems\.org">rubygems.org</a>”</p>

<p>gem “actionpack”, “2.3.8” gem “activemerchant” . .fi . .IP “” 0 . .P In
this case, both fBactionpackfR and fBactivemerchantfR depend on
fBactivesupportfR. The fBactionpackfR gem depends on fBactivesupport
2.3.8fR and fBrack ~&gt; 1.1.0fR, while the fBactivemerchantfR gem depends
on fBactivesupport &gt;= 2.3.2fR, fBbraintree &gt;= 2.0.0fR, and fBbuilder
&gt;= 2.0.0fR. . .P When the dependencies are first resolved, <a
href="../../../Bundler.html">Bundler</a> will select fBactivesupport
2.3.8fR, which satisfies the requirements of both gems in your Gemfile(5).
. .P Next, you modify your Gemfile(5) to: . .IP “” 4 . .nf</p>

<p>source “<a href="https://rubygems\.org">rubygems.org</a>”</p>

<p>gem “actionpack”, “3.0.0.rc” gem “activemerchant” . .fi . .IP “” 0 . .P The
fBactionpack 3.0.0.rcfR gem has a number of new dependencies, and updates
the fBactivesupportfR dependency to fB= 3.0.0.rcfR and the fBrackfR
dependency to fB~&gt; 1.2.1fR. . .P When you run fBbundle installfR, <a
href="../../../Bundler.html">Bundler</a> notices that you changed the
fBactionpackfR gem, but not the fBactivemerchantfR gem. It evaluates the
gems currently being used to satisfy its requirements: . .TP
fBactivesupport 2.3.8fR also used to satisfy a dependency in
fBactivemerchantfR, which is not being updated . .TP fBrack ~&gt; 1.1.0fR
not currently being used to satisfy another dependency . .P Because you did
not explicitly ask to update fBactivemerchantfR, you would not expect it to
suddenly stop working after updating fBactionpackfR. However, satisfying
the new fBactivesupport 3.0.0.rcfR dependency of actionpack requires
updating one of its dependencies. . .P Even though fBactivemerchantfR
declares a very loose dependency that theoretically matches fBactivesupport
3.0.0.rcfR, bundler treats gems in your Gemfile(5) that have not changed as
an atomic unit together with their dependencies. In this case, the
fBactivemerchantfR dependency is treated as fBactivemerchant 1.7.1 +
activesupport 2.3.8fR, so fBbundle installfR will report that it cannot
update fBactionpackfR. . .P To explicitly update fBactionpackfR, including
its dependencies which other gems in the Gemfile(5) still depend on, run
fBbundle update actionpackfR (see fBbundle update(1)fR). . .P fBSummaryfR:
In general, after making a change to the Gemfile(5) , you should first try
to run fBbundle installfR, which will guarantee that no other gems in the
Gemfile(5) are impacted by the change. If that does not work, run bundle
update(1) fIbundle-update.1.htmlfR. . .SH “SEE ALSO” . .IP “(bu” 4 Gem
