<p>Support for <a href="Treetop.html">Treetop</a> is provided through the
mailing list you can join or browse here: <a
href="http://groups.google.com/group/treetop-dev">groups.google.com/group/treetop-dev</a></p>

<h1 id="label-Tutorial">Tutorial<span><a href="#label-Tutorial">&para;</a> <a href="#documentation">&uarr;</a></span></h1>

<p>Languages can be split into two components, their <em>syntax</em> and their
<em>semantics</em>. It’s your understanding of English syntax that tells
you the stream of words “Sleep furiously green ideas colorless” is not a
valid sentence. Semantics is deeper. Even if we rearrange the above
sentence to be “Colorless green ideas sleep furiously”, which is
syntactically correct, it remains nonsensical on a semantic level. With <a
href="Treetop.html">Treetop</a>, you’ll be dealing with languages that are
much simpler than English, but these basic concepts apply. Your programs
will need to address both the syntax and the semantics of the languages
they interpret.</p>

<p><a href="Treetop.html">Treetop</a> equips you with powerful tools for each
of these two aspects of interpreter writing. You'll describe the syntax of
your language with a <em>parsing expression grammar</em>. From this
description, <a href="Treetop.html">Treetop</a> will generate a Ruby parser
that transforms streams of characters written into your language into
<em>abstract syntax trees</em> representing their structure. You'll then
describe the semantics of your language in Ruby by defining methods on the
syntax trees the parser generates.</p>

<h1 id="label-Parsing+Expression+Grammars%2C+The+Basics">Parsing Expression Grammars, The Basics<span><a href="#label-Parsing+Expression+Grammars%2C+The+Basics">&para;</a> <a href="#documentation">&uarr;</a></span></h1>

<p>The first step in using <a href="Treetop.html">Treetop</a> is defining a
grammar in a file with the <code>.treetop</code> extension. Here’s a
grammar that’s useless because it’s empty:</p>

<pre># my_grammar.treetop
grammar MyGrammar
end</pre>

<p>Next, you start filling your grammar with rules. Each rule associates a
name with a parsing expression, like the following:</p>

<pre># my_grammar.treetop
# You can use a .tt extension instead if you wish
grammar MyGrammar
  rule hello
    'hello chomsky'
  end
end</pre>

<p>The first rule becomes the <em>root</em> of the grammar, causing its
expression to be matched when a parser for the grammar is fed a string. The
above grammar can now be used in a Ruby program. Notice how a string
matching the first rule parses successfully, but a second nonmatching
string does not.</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-comment"># use_grammar.rb</span>
<span class="ruby-identifier">require</span> <span class="ruby-string">'rubygems'</span>
<span class="ruby-identifier">require</span> <span class="ruby-string">'treetop'</span>
<span class="ruby-constant">Treetop</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">load</span> <span class="ruby-string">'my_grammar'</span>
<span class="ruby-comment"># or just:</span>
<span class="ruby-comment"># require 'my_grammar'                     # This works because Polyglot hooks &quot;require&quot; to find and load Treetop files</span>
    
<span class="ruby-identifier">parser</span> = <span class="ruby-constant">MyGrammarParser</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">new</span>
<span class="ruby-identifier">puts</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">parser</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">parse</span>(<span class="ruby-string">'hello chomsky'</span>)         <span class="ruby-comment"># =&gt; Treetop::Runtime::SyntaxNode</span>

</pre>

<p>Users of <em>regular expressions</em> will find parsing expressions
familiar. They share the same basic purpose, matching strings against
patterns. However, parsing expressions can recognize a broader category of
languages than their less expressive brethren. Before we get into
demonstrating that, lets cover some basics. At first parsing expressions
won’t seem much different. Trust that they are.</p>

<h2 id="label-Terminal+Symbols">Terminal Symbols<span><a href="#label-Terminal+Symbols">&para;</a> <a href="#documentation">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p>The expression in the grammar above is a terminal symbol. It will only
match a string that matches it exactly. There are two other kinds of
terminal symbols, which we’ll revisit later. Terminals are called
<em>atomic expressions</em> because they aren’t composed of smaller
expressions. A terminal symbol may use either double or single quotes. If
the closing quote is immediately followed by the modifier ‘i’, the string
is matched without case-sensitivity, that is, the input.downcase matches
the terminal.downcase</p>

<p><a href="Treetop.html">Treetop</a> now also supports regular expressions as
terminals. Use a string as before, but append the modifier character 'r'
(you can combine this with 'i' to get case-insensitive regular
expressions). Regular expressions are generally faster than the equivalent
parsing expressions, but may have polynomial worst-case behaviour, which is
worse than parsing expressions. Your regular expression will always be
anchored (by prepending A) to test the current location of the input, so
some special expressions like b for word boundaries may give unexpected
results.</p>

<h2 id="label-Ordered+Choices">Ordered Choices<span><a href="#label-Ordered+Choices">&para;</a> <a href="#documentation">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p>Ordered choices are <em>composite expressions</em>, which allow for any of
several subexpressions to be matched. These should be familiar from regular
expressions, but in parsing expressions, they are delimited by the
<code>/</code> character. Its important to note that the choices are
prioritized in the order they appear. If an earlier expression is matched,
no subsequent expressions are tried. Here’s an example:</p>

<pre># my_grammar.treetop
grammar MyGrammar
  rule hello
    'hello chomsky' / 'hello lambek'
  end
end</pre>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-comment"># fragment of use_grammar.rb</span>
<span class="ruby-identifier">puts</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">parser</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">parse</span>(<span class="ruby-string">'hello chomsky'</span>)         <span class="ruby-comment"># =&gt; Treetop::Runtime::SyntaxNode</span>
<span class="ruby-identifier">puts</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">parser</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">parse</span>(<span class="ruby-string">'hello lambek'</span>)          <span class="ruby-comment"># =&gt; Treetop::Runtime::SyntaxNode</span>
<span class="ruby-identifier">puts</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">parser</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">parse</span>(<span class="ruby-string">'silly generativists!'</span>)  <span class="ruby-comment"># =&gt; nil</span>
</pre>

<p>Note that once a choice rule has matched the text using a particular
alternative at a particular location in the input and hence has succeeded,
that choice will never be reconsidered, even if the chosen alternative
causes another rule to fail where a later alternative wouldn’t have. It’s
always a later alternative, since the first to succeed is final - why keep
looking when you’ve found what you wanted? This is a feature of PEG parsers
that you need to understand if you’re going to succeed in using <a
href="Treetop.html">Treetop</a>. In order to memoize success and failures,
such decisions cannot be reversed. Luckily <a
href="Treetop.html">Treetop</a> provides a variety of clever ways you can
tell it to avoid making the wrong decisions. But more on that later.</p>

<h2 id="label-Sequences">Sequences<span><a href="#label-Sequences">&para;</a> <a href="#documentation">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p>Sequences are composed of other parsing expressions separated by spaces.
Using sequences, we can tighten up the above grammar.</p>

<pre># my_grammar.treetop
grammar MyGrammar
  rule hello
    'hello ' ('chomsky' / 'lambek')
  end
end</pre>

<p>Note the use of parentheses to override the default precedence rules, which
bind sequences more tightly than choices.</p>

<p>Once the whole sequence has been matched, the result is memoized and the
details of the match will not be reconsidered for that location in the
input.</p>

<h2 id="label-Nonterminal+Symbols">Nonterminal Symbols<span><a href="#label-Nonterminal+Symbols">&para;</a> <a href="#documentation">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p>Here we leave regular expressions behind. Nonterminals allow expressions to
refer to other expressions by name. A trivial use of this facility would
allow us to make the above grammar more readable should the list of names
grow longer.</p>

<pre># my_grammar.treetop
grammar MyGrammar
  rule hello
    'hello ' linguist
  end

  rule linguist
    'chomsky' / 'lambek' / 'jacobsen' / 'frege'
  end
end</pre>

<p>The true power of this facility, however, is unleashed when writing
<em>recursive expressions</em>. Here is a self-referential expression that
can match any number of open parentheses followed by any number of closed
parentheses. This is theoretically impossible with regular expressions due
to the <em>pumping lemma</em>.</p>

<pre># parentheses.treetop
grammar Parentheses
  rule parens
    '(' parens ')' / ''
  end
end</pre>

<p>The <code>parens</code> expression simply states that a <code>parens</code>
is a set of parentheses surrounding another <code>parens</code> expression
or, if that doesn’t match, the empty string. If you are uncomfortable with
recursion, its time to get comfortable, because it is the basis of
language. Here’s a tip: Don’t try and imagine the parser circling round and
round through the same rule. Instead, imagine the rule is <em>already</em>
defined while you are defining it. If you imagine that <code>parens</code>
already matches a string of matching parentheses, then its easy to think of
<code>parens</code> as an open and closing parentheses around another set
of matching parentheses, which conveniently, you happen to be defining. You
know that <code>parens</code> is supposed to represent a string of matched
parentheses, so trust in that meaning, even if you haven’t fully
implemented it yet.</p>

<h2 id="label-Repetition">Repetition<span><a href="#label-Repetition">&para;</a> <a href="#documentation">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p>Any item in a rule may be followed by a ‘+’ or a ‘*’ character, signifying
one-or-more and zero-or-more occurrences of that item. Beware though; the
match is greedy, and if it matches too many items and causes subsequent
items in the sequence to fail, the number matched will never be
reconsidered. Here’s a simple example of a rule that will never succeed:</p>

<pre># toogreedy.treetop
grammar TooGreedy
  rule a_s
    'a'* 'a'
  end
end</pre>

<p>The ‘a’* will always eat up any ‘a’s that follow, and the subsequent ‘a’
will find none there, so the whole rule will fail. You might need to use
lookahead to avoid matching too much. Alternatively, you can use an
occurrence range:</p>

<pre># toogreedy.treetop
grammar TooGreedy
  rule two_to_four_as
    'a' 2..4
  end
end</pre>

<p>In an occurrence range, you may omit either the minimum count or the
maximum count, so that “0.. ” works like “*” and “1.. ” works like ‘+’.</p>

<h2 id="label-Negative+Lookahead">Negative Lookahead<span><a href="#label-Negative+Lookahead">&para;</a> <a href="#documentation">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p>When you need to ensure that the following item <em>doesn’t</em> match in
some case where it might otherwise, you can use negat!ve lookahead, which
is an item preceeded by a ! - here’s an example:</p>

<pre># postcondition.treetop
grammar PostCondition
  rule conditional_sentence
    ( !conditional_keyword word )+ conditional_keyword [ \t]+ word*
  end

  rule word
    ([a-zA-Z]+ [ \t]+) 
  end

  rule conditional_keyword
    'if' / 'while' / 'until'
  end
end</pre>

<p>Even though the rule <code>word</code> would match any of the conditional
keywords, the first words of a conditional_sentence must not be
conditional_keywords. The negative lookahead prevents that matching, and
prevents the repetition from matching too much input. Note that the
lookahead may be a grammar rule of any complexity, including one that isn’t
used elsewhere in your grammar.</p>

<h2 id="label-Positive+lookahead">Positive lookahead<span><a href="#label-Positive+lookahead">&para;</a> <a href="#documentation">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p>Sometimes you want an item to match, but only if the <em>following</em>
text would match some pattern. You don’t want to consume that following
text, but if it’s not there, you want this rule to fail. You can append a
positive lookahead like this to a rule by appending the lookahead rule
preceeded by an &amp; character.</p>

<h2 id="label-Semantic+predicates">Semantic predicates<span><a href="#label-Semantic+predicates">&para;</a> <a href="#documentation">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p>Warning: This is an advanced feature. You need to understand the way a
packrat parser operates to use it correctly. The result of computing a rule
containing a semantic predicate will be memoized, even if the same rule,
applied later at the same location in the input, would work differently due
to a semantic predicate returning a different value. If you don’t
understand the previous sentence yet still use this feature, you’re on your
own, so test carefully!</p>

<p>Sometimes, you need to run external Ruby code to decide whether this syntax
rule should continue or should fail. You can do this using either positive
or negative semantic predicates. These are Ruby code blocks (lambdas) which
are called when the parser reaches that location. For this rule to succeed,
the value must be true for a positive predicate (a block like &amp;{ … }),
or false for a negative predicate (a block like !{ … }).</p>

<p>The block is called with one argument, the array containing the preceding
syntax nodes in the current sequence. Within the block, you cannot use node
names or labels for the preceding nodes, as the node for the current rule
does not yet exist. You must refer to preceding nodes using their position
in the sequence.</p>

  <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>

  <span class="ruby-identifier">rule</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">reserved</span>

  <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>

  <span class="ruby-identifier">rule</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">word</span>
    ([<span class="ruby-identifier">a</span><span class="ruby-operator">-</span><span class="ruby-identifier">zA</span><span class="ruby-operator">-</span><span class="ruby-constant">Z</span>]<span class="ruby-operator">+</span> [ \<span class="ruby-identifier">t</span>]<span class="ruby-operator">+</span>) 
  <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
</pre>

<p>One case where it is always safe to use a semantic predicate is to invoke
the Ruby debugger, but don’t forget to return true so the rule succeeds!
Assuming you have required the ‘ruby-debug’ module somewhere, it looks like
this:</p>

<pre class="ruby">  <span class="ruby-identifier">rule</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">problems</span>
    <span class="ruby-identifier">word</span> <span class="ruby-operator">&amp;</span>{ <span class="ruby-operator">|</span><span class="ruby-identifier">s</span><span class="ruby-operator">|</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">debugger</span>; <span class="ruby-keyword">true</span> }
  <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
</pre>

<p>When the debugger stops here, you can inspect the contents of the
SyntaxNode for “word” by looking at <a href="0">s</a>, and the stack trace
will show how you got there.</p>
